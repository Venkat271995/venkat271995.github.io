<div id="overflowTest">
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Virtual Reality</b></p>
<p>This unprecedented<b> LOCKDOWN</b> has <b>UNLOCKED</b> a brand new US!</p>
<p><b>When we were all busy chasing something in this chaotic world, there came a PAUSE…</b></p>
<p>To think what we are all actually searching for, losing the real us in this journey, when money can’t save lives at this moment…</p>
<p>To realize life is worth more than what we thought of, only when fear strikes us in the form of a micro-organism… </p>
<p>To celebrate the people around us each day with love, as we experience life is uncertain…</p>
<p>To remember and thank people each day, who are rendering their selfless services at this time to the Human kind, even putting themselves at risk…</p>
<p>To mourn for the damage we have done to The Mother Nature seeing the happy pictures of Her healing Herself, which we always took for granted but never again…</p>
<p>To thank this lockdown for making us remember that we have two words, ‘H’&’E’, in our dictionary as  a solution for everything, which will otherwise become extinct, the words! </p>
 <p>                       ‘<b>H</b>UMANITY’ to sustain The World! </p>
  <p>                      ‘<b>E</b>MPATHY’ to sustain The Living Creatures!! </p>
<p>Though these are not the physical habits, we should take this LOCKDOWN lesson soulfully and make all these VALUBALE (VIRTUAL) HABITS to be part of us, in The New World we are going to step into. <p>
<p>WE WILL!!</p>

<div id="overflowTest">
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Quarantine Visit</b></p>
<p>Words were spreading in The Woods about The Caged Humans. And all the species got curious to know ‘Why?’ and ‘How?. They desperately wanted to go visit them. Steps were taken from their side regarding this. Request to visit The Caged Humans was submitted to Highness.</i></p>
<p>Orders were issued to all the brothers and sisters of Animal Kingdom, giving permission for their visit to The Caged Humans!</p>
<p>The Day of the visit!</p>
<p>All species of animals came in flocks and groups and even in single to visit them in cages.</p>
<p><b>THE ANIMALS WERE PASSING THE CAGES SEEING HUMANS IN AMUSEMENT WITH SO MANY EXCITING AND CURIOUS QUESTIONS AND WEIRD THOUGHTS RUNNING THROUGH THEM AND ……………………</b></p>
<p>The Elephants was wondering and murmuring among them, ‘Look, how tiny these Humans are? Aah… They could drink water with their hands...!’ and they lost into the sight of the Humans drinking water!</p>
<p>The Zebras, the moment they saw the Humans, was like, ‘What a dull creature they should be, with no crosses or nothing!’ and felt pity for each humans with sober single color! </p>
<p>The Chimpanzee bro, kept watching intensely the Humans activities, decoding how these humans look-alike them to a certain extent, meanwhile, a baby Chimp wanted to throw a banana from her hand just to witness how the human would peel and eat it… Curiosity! Of course, they enjoyed the play! </p>
<p>The Flock of Monkeys went beyond their excitement jumping and flinging by just seeing the humans in cages! </p>
<p>The Peacock and Peahen were in the middle of a hot debate, distinguishing the gender of the humans, getting confused between male and female! Peacock went like, ‘Honey, can we just put our debate aside, and enjoy our visit!’ and enjoyed watching as they can’t distinguish as every Human were wearing colorful cloths! </p>
<p>A group of four Deer’s made their hopping entry and stopped at the very first cage, wondering at the sight of Humans having 2 legs on the ground and 2 legs floating in the air.. ‘Oh God’, shouted a deer, the other went like, ‘They walk!’, to which the other replied, ‘God, oh pity of them, how could they even hop when they are happy!’. And in amusement they were walking past all cages! </p>
<p>A Male Rhino with a mandatory forced ‘Single’ status with no existing female of its species, was genuinely happy seeing The Human Couple in a cage sharing their thoughts and grief’s and making love! </p>
<p>When the Leopardess and the cubs were enjoying their visit, the Leopard took his seat in a wooden log near a single Human cage and was just staring at him, thinking ,’Why he is all alone there, out of will or force?!’ and then his cubs and the wife interrupted into his thoughts to give the answer ‘Out of force’! </p>
<p>A Giraffe bent down her long neck to look into the Humans in close proximity and the instant thought of her was, ‘My neck aches badly bending so much to see you buddies, but still you are worth for a shot!’ and got back to normal stature, grinning and felt sigh as her parents couldn’t make today to witness the Humans!</p>
<p>Flocks of Camels were serenely enjoying their visit, when one Calf screamed in astonishment, ‘These creatures have got water everywhere around them… look look the one in the left corner cage is having it right in his hand filled in some object!’ The other Camel went like, ‘oh yeah, guys, see to my side of the cage, they get it directly from some kind of an object by just screwing it’. Now time for the nerdy Camel to speak, ‘ I knew it. It is called The Pipe. Water just gushes out of it anytime every time when screwed. The curse of ours turns to be the blessing of them if… if not taken advantage of it!’ as the Camels were listening to their nerdy dude, were still in awe of ‘anytime every time’!</p>
<p>The Tigers with their Majestic walk, walked past the cages with a pause in front of each cage and murmuring among them, leaving no idea of what would that murmur would have been… but for sure they enjoyed the sight of the Humans in cages, witnessed with the constant proud grin, running through all the faces of The Tiger Dudes.</p>
<p>The Lion made a roaring entry accompanied by a group of Lioness and cubs, made a gesture to his Tiger pal standing aside and engaged into Human – watching. The Lioness was like, ‘See here, my lil ones, they are called The Humans, okay. They are our <b>‘mere co-existing creatures’</b>, nothing more or less. They get caged when The Mother Nature thinks they deserve it to get things right and to heal Herself. We have been permitted to see them today as a reward for us of not taking anything for granted!’ and the cubs nodded taking their first impactful lesson for lifetime! </p>
<p><b>…………….AND EMPATHY SOMEWHERE AROUND THE CORNER FOR EACH ANE EVERY ONE OF THE CREATURE SEEING THE HUMANS IN CAGES!!!! </b></p>
<p>The visiting hours was over and all the species of animals came out of the Human Zoo with a mixed emotions of finally seeing The Humans and questioning among them went like,</p>
 <p> ‘Don’t they deserve to be free like us? They should be free like us. They will be good. Can we all talk to The Mother Nature on their behalf and give guarantee for them?!’ and they all turned towards The King, who was standing beside his pal The Tiger and they both instantly nodded<b> ‘YES!’. </b></p>
<p><b>After their pleading, The Mother Nature fulfilled their selfless wish, which only they can do!!</b></p>

<p>Know something.. I am just extra piece of flesh destined for the time of my motherhood!</p>
<p>Thats all about me!I swear you folks!!Nothing more!!!Nothing!!!</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>But..I feel certain stuffs because of the angle of perspectives of my own gender and the others on me!</p>
<p>I feel like I am misinterpreted to be weapon for your pleasure.</p>
 <p>I feel like you have been misleaded in your thought processing.</p>
 <p>I feel like your minds have some inculcated stuffs about me already,like an automated program in a machine</p>
<p>I feel like I am overrated everytime except the time when I am pumping out the production of mine to the little infant of my handler. <p>
<p>I fell like I dont deserve all this attention when my clothes make me obvious.</p>
<p>I feel like to yell-'I am not on display!, when I am on streets and the eyes of atleast half the passersby be like..'Hey you..you really got some!'</p>
<p>I feel like telling them-'can you please let me alone?',because I knew I have got some and thats why I am called The Breasts.</p>
<p>I feel like suffocating not because of my wrapper-the brassiere,but because of the eroneous gazes I am victimized to.</p>
<p>I feel like I am the most protected in any kind because of all the two..three layers of shield I get to cover on me.</p>
<p>I feel like  I am tired of every drama created around me or based on me.</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>I feel like I am gender biased as I dont make my presence on one gender..which makes me grind the million dollar question in me always like - 'Will I have not been the victim of anything mentioned above,if I was not really a gender biased kind(meaning present in all the gender)?!?!!?!!!</p>
<p>Would I have escaped all these?!?!?!</p>

<p>You will start liking Kamal Hassan movies.. </p>
<p>You will take a decision right analysing the situation.. </p>
<p>You will cry but will make sure others don't get affected by it.. </p>

<p>You will love to have your own self pampering time once in a while.. </p>
<p>You will definitely have extreme fun but knowing your limits.. </p>
<p>You will know even liberty is restricted.. </p>

<p>A home amidst the mild forest&#127794;.. </p>
<p>It was past noon.. </p>
<p>Trees&#127796; standing straight stalking people.. </p>
<p>Grasses looking into the ants&#128028; running.. </p>
<p>Deers&#129420;	just	walking..Elephants&#128024;	sitting

<p>Seems like a bit lousy day. </p>
<p>Sensing all this .. An intimate friend of ours wanted deliberately to come and visit us just to cheer ' us ' up ! </p>
<p>But her schedule to visit us is some weeks later .. so She seeks permission to visit us from Her Highness.. Permission Granted !! </p>

<p>Chillness making us thrilled.. </p>
<p>Peacock&#127752; in the start of opening up his feathers.. </p>
<p>And yes.. We witness Her storehouse - The Black Clouds towards us.. </p>

<p>Hits the ground</p>
<p>And makes a hop in happiness</p>
<p>as she made her way to visit us successfully </p><p>Oh. How awestruck we were witnessing it !!</p>
<p>And the grasses are the blessed ones to watch it closely .. and yeah we are lil jealous about you Ill grass !!</p>

<h2  id="C10" style="color:#4db1bc;text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px red;padding:0px;width=20%;animation: glow 2s ease-in-out infinite alternate;"><b>Wisdom Room - "The naming ceremony of Humanity"</b></h2>
<div id="overflowTest">

<p id="C10" style="text-align:center"><b>THE WISDOM ROOM</b></p>
<p>Some thousands and thousands of years back.. </p>
<p>There was a meeting.. one day.. in the most wise place meaning a high power meeting among the intelligentsia of all the animals. It was about naming of a particular quality they all possessed, but not named yet .. hot debates and discussions all over the room happening. </p>
<p>*wise discussions* </p> 
<p>*fruitful debates*</p>
<p>And finally, they all came to a conclusion to name it .. </p>
<p>The new name for the amazing quality is – HUMANITY! </p>
<p>Now, as the world outside was so eager of the naming ceremony happening in THE WISDOM ROOM,  they came out after their finalization and announced it to the world.. The Wisdom Room was the most respected room of the time filled with wisest members ever! </p>
<p>*Announcement* - HUMANITY it is named to the greatest quality of all time! </p>
<p>Crowd was happy but still there was murmuring sounds going around among everybody except one section which was excited for the name. The questions rose from the public to the intelligentsia like... Why is this name… Why based on them... Why not us... Why particularly them...  And so many random and thought provoking questions. </p>
<p>The intelligentsia who chose the name.. was having a witty smirk and their face expression makes it obvious that this is the reaction they were exactly expecting from the crowd. They all had the same look .. A wise smirk.. and left the place with no explanation, as if they will not reveal it ‘WHY’ but TIME WILL! </p>
<p>How wise and intelligent must have they been!! </p>
<p>*A gentle reminder – The intelligentsia in the Wisdom room has the representatives from all the breeds of animals!* </p>
<p>AS they didn’t reveal it, time passed, years passed, the world was rapidly changing .. CHANGED actually from the time of the Wisdom room meeting. The Wisdom room was more of like conspiracy theory and it must been by now be under the grounds or somewhere hidden in mud or water or whatever. </p>
<p>The ‘ TODAYS WORLD ‘ had no idea about it to be frank. Do you. Nay right! </p>
<p>But on one usual day, in the woods, as usual the creatures there were busy and idle in their activities. To their surprise, they discovered something strange peeping out from the bushes slightly – a structure. At first they were all like.. How have we not noticed it for so long.. was the immediate thoughts beyond their curiosity. They were like.. set aside the bushes and see what it is!! CURIOSITY!! </p>
<p>They were into the operation now. To their surprise, it was a cave with a room like inside, meaning it was in use ONCE. They started exploring it. In the entrance of the cave was carved a name – THE WISDOM ROOM! They all became astonished as the stories of The Wisdom room was still going rounds since then but with added flavor as per time to it.  They were like – ‘ oh yay, its true! ‘.</p>
<p>Okay. THE WISDOM ROOM it is. They went on to see the carved table-like, bench-like, cupboard-like structures. And there was inscriptions all over the wall left undisturbed. Among the inscriptions, there was one highlighted one with border .. and all their heads turned towards it. Little did they knew that… they were getting to get  known to the biggest prediction ever and be proud of their wise ancestors!! </p>
<p>Highlighted Script went like.. </p>
<p>*This amazing quality is named after The Human Breed as ‘ HUMANITY ‘. It is not because of the over expressing of them this quality. Nor because of Partiality. Each and Every Breed is equal for us in our place - The World. Everybody of you has the same life. Not because, The Humans have an extra 6th sense, its not that their life is something superior than others. Life is Life, no matter whatever breed you are. But this 6th sense in The Humans, one day, will make them self-boasting, will make them do changes and rule the world as if it belongs only to them. Their belonging.. reducing the life of other breeds to theirs. There will come a day, where this quality which is possessed immensely in them today, will be in negligible amount one day, a stage of almost extinct. When that is happening.. will happen.. atleast the name Humanity which bears their name will make them to hold it in some form, as they should possess it to run the world good. Or else, they will not even notice the Word – and will make it from negligible to Extinct. The Others – Its not that you don’t possess Humanity, you possess it in abundance now and will possess it forever. Just thank the absent 6th sense in you breeds. SO, THIS WISDOM ROOM, NAMES THIS WORDLY QUALITY – HUMANITY, AFTER THE ANIMAL BREED – HUMAN, AS IT WOULD ATLEAST REMIND THEM OF THIS WHEN THEY INSANELY RULE THE WORLD IN THE COMING DAYS..!* </p>
<p>The creatures now ..i.e. the other animal breeds now.. realizing – WE WERE ALL ONCE LIVING UNDER ONE ROOF .. closed the cave with bushes again and left the divine cave in silence with pride for their still possessed quality in abundance and an anguished smirk  thinking about The Human Breed.</p>
